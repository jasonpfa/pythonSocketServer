This project is a submission by Jason Pfannebecker and Matthew McKinney


Before Scenario 1:
Place server.py, client1.py, and client2.py in a new project in PyCharm.

Run server.py, note the ip and port given (running server.py will create the server folder if it doesn't exist)

Run client1.py, then input CONNECT [given ip] [given port] (running client1.py will create the client1 folder if it doesn't exist)

Run client2.py, then input CONNECT [given ip] [given port] (running client2.py will create the client2 folder if it doesn't exist)

Place TS.txt, AS.mp3, and VS.mp4 in the serverroot folder

Place TC2.txt in client2.txt


Scenario 1:
Run server.py, client1.py, and client2.py

Connect both client 1 and client 2 to the server by typing CONNECT (ip given by server) 9998

In client 1 type DOWNLOAD TS.txt

TS.txt will be downloaded to the client1root folder

Delete TS.txt from client1root before continuing to another scenario


Scenario 2:

Strategy 2-1 :
Run server.py, client1.py, and client2.py

Connect both client 1 and client 2 to the server by typing CONNECT (ip given by server) 9998

In client 1 type DOWNLOAD21 TS.txt TC2.txt

TS.txt and TC2.txt will be downloaded to the client1root folder

Delete TS.txt and TC2.txt from client1root before continuing to another strategy/scenario


Strategy 2-2 :
Run server.py, client1.py, and client2.py

Connect both client 1 and client 2 to the server by typing CONNECT (ip given by server) 9998

In client 1 type DOWNLOAD22 TS.txt TC2.txt

TS.txt and TC2.txt will be downloaded to the client1root folder

Delete TS.txt and TC2.txt from client1root before continuing to another strategy/scenario


Strategy 2-3 :
Run server.py, client1.py, and client2.py

Connect both client 1 and client 2 to the server by typing CONNECT (ip given by server) 9998

In client 1 type DOWNLOAD23 TS.txt TC2.txt

TS.txt and TC2.txt will be downloaded to the client1root folder

Delete TS.txt and TC2.txt from client1root before continuing to another strategy/scenario


Scenario 3:
This can be tested by following any of the scenarios/strategies above but at a distance on the same network.

The resulting time will be evident that the clients and server have distance between them.
